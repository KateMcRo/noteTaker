# Note Taker

## Description

This is a note taking app that allows users to write and save notes to help keep track of tasks that need completing. Notes can be saved, viewed, and deleted.

Key takeaways from buiding this project:
- file organization is crucial
- routes follow a logical path

## Usage

Click the "Get Started" button on the landing page.

On the left side will be any saved notes. On the right side is a place holder for "Note Title" and "Note Text". When the user clicks into this area to write a note, a save icon will appear. Once they have input their note, they can click the save icon to update the tracked note list.
